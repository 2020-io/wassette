* Matt's thoughts from 8/26/2025
- Web assembly thoughts: Lots of languages compile to this, can be used for Agents
- Our XMP component is a MCP catalog and provides the common interface to LLMs
- XMP would have a route to add/remove/list of container registries
- This resource can really just be :type, :path
- This resource returns global MCP servers, and per-group, and current-user only
- Matt suggested we make this to separate namespaces (oci vs mcp)
- XMP would self-register itself as an MCP server to expose oci components?
-- or XMP acts as a container registry
- XMP has WebAssembly Agents
- XMP is more than a proxy and router, it contains Role Policies, and request introspection
