- What Wassette is (MCP server running Tools as WebAssembly components)
- Who it's for (developers, system administrators, security-conscious users)
- Key benefits (security, isolation, cross-platform compatibility)
- How to navigate the documentation

### 2. Comprehensive Installation Guide (`installation.md`)
Create a unified installation guide that:
- Provides overview of all installation methods
- Guides users to choose the best method for their platform
- Links to specific installation methods (Homebrew, Nix, Winget, source builds)
- Includes verification steps and troubleshooting

### 3. Development Setup Guide (`development.md`)
Add a guide for contributors covering:
- Setting up development environment
- Building from source
- Running tests
- Code style and contribution guidelines
- Debugging with MCP inspector
- Using Justfile commands

### 4. Examples and Usage (`examples.md`)
Create an examples showcase with:
- Language support matrix showing which languages are supported for WASM tools
- Step-by-step examples of creating and using WASM tools

## Suggested Content Improvements

### Documentation Structure
- Add clear navigation hierarchy with logical grouping
- Include search functionality (already provided by mdbook)
- Add edit links for community contributions (already configured)
- Ensure mobile-friendly responsive design (provided by mdbook)

### Content Enhancements
- Add code examples with syntax highlighting
- Include diagrams for architecture documentation
- Provide troubleshooting sections
